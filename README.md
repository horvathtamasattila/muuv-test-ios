# muuv-test-ios

I used xcodegen to generate the project file. It's not needed to open the project, just to explain the `.yml` files.

I mostly put emphasis on the architecture and dev. environment, the UI is just something basic I came up with. It might seems that some of the solutions I used are a bit overcomplicated, I just wanted to share how I think about solving problems in a scaled app (sharing data between independent views, modularization, coordinator ect..)

Features:
 - Getting a list a users, with being able to change pages
 - Getting details about a user
 - Updating a user, though I did not have time to add a UI representation of the update (could have added two more texts to make it more visible)
 
 - I also didn't have time to do write tests, sorry for that
